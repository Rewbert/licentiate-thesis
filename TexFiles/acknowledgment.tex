many thank

% I would like to thank my supervisor, Koen Claessen, for being a good friend and mentor. We have many interesting discussions
% together, of which only a fraction are about work!

% Aside from having a great supervisor, I am blessed with two excellent co-supervisors. In addition to saying that
% they are both great friends, I wish to thank John Hughes, for asking me the right
% questions and making me think, and Bo Joel Svensson, for his never ending support and trying to teach me to be a hacker, just like
% himself.

% There are too many friends, colleagues, and collaborators that deservers acknowledgements for a section as short as this one.
% I do, however, wish to single out Abhiroop Sarkar, for being a good friend and terrific office-mate.

% I wish to thank Troels Henriksen for agreeing to be my discussion leader, and for giving me feedback while I was
% writing on this thesis.

% Lastly, I wish to thank my family for their support, encouragement, and understanding. My greatest appreciation goes to my
% girls, Therese and Astrid, for helping me remember that there is a wonderful life to live outside of work.
