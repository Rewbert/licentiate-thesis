\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
\vspace{5 mm}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Koen Claessen, for being a good friend and mentor. We have many interesting discussions
together, of which only a fraction is about work!

Aside from having a great supervisor, I am blessed with two excellent co-supervisors. In addition to saying that
they are both great friends, I wish to thank John Hughes, for asking me the right
questions and making me think, and Bo Joel Svensson, for his never-ending support, and for teaching me to be a
hacker, just like himself.

There are too many friends, colleagues, and collaborators that deserve acknowledgments.
I do, however, wish to single out Abhiroop Sarkar, for being a good friend and terrific office mate.

I wish to thank Troels Henriksen for agreeing to be my discussion leader, and for giving me feedback on this thesis.

Lastly, I wish to thank my family for their support, encouragement, and understanding. My greatest appreciation goes to my
girls, my partner Therese and her wonderful Astrid, for helping me remember that there is a joyful life to live outside
of work.
